<p>What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?</p>
<ol>
<li>Information gathering</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>Testing & delivery</li>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ol>
<p>What is your site's primary goal or purpose? I am hoping to attract future employers to look at my credentials and be interested in what I can offer them.</p>
<p>What kind of content will your site feature? What I can do in software development. My background</p>
<p>What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?</p>
<p>Employers are interested in knowing what types of programming languages I learned, they might want to know about projects I have done. They would be interested in knowing what experience I have prior to programming, since a knowledge of a topic (accounting, translation, finance) or an industry (telecom, biotech, etc) could help a front end programmer to better understand what the interface should have. A backend programmer would know what capability the software should provide. </p>
<p>What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? </p>
<p>Move to the languages I know. Move to my background</p>
<p>Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.</p>
<p> Seeing my resume is OK, as long as it is generic. I prefer provide the more detailed resume upon demand. Seeing my programing projects is OK. I also prefer to provide the code I wrote upon demand as well.</p>
<p>What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</p>
<p> The user’s experience is influenced by usability, navigation, accessibility. These 3 characteristic are created by the web designer.</p>
<p>What is user experience design and why is it valuable? </p>
<p>The success of a website depends on the user’s perception. The user’s perception depends on the design of the website. The perception will be based on ease of use, pleasant to use, utility, efficiency</p>
<p>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious? Dealing with markdown. Converting my scanned image into a jpg file.   couldn't find why my image wouldn't copy on my md file.</p>
