<p>•	What is a one-to-one database?</p>
<p>I don’t think we can do relationship between databases but we can within a database between tables. A one-to-one relationship is when there can be only one element in a table that can be related to another table and that table can also have only one element related to the other table. I used the example of my house. iI has only one garage: one house(table house) for one garage(table garage), one garage for one house.</p>
<p>▪	When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).</p>
<p>When there is no but one possibility . </p>
<p>•	What is a many-to-many database?</p>
<p>Again, I don’t think we can do relationship between databases but we can within a database between tables. A many-to-many relationship is when there can be several possibilities in one table that can be linked to several possibilities in another table. We can belong to several religions (a religion table) and the religions can have several followers (table followers). </p>
<p>•	When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).</p>
<p>Where there are several possibilities between tables.  </p>
<p>•	What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?</p>
<p>Well, nothing in here is confusing to me. This is the easiest I have had to work with at DevBootCamp.It is logical for me.</p>
