 /***
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

Making sure that the file path is correct and located in the right directory.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

We visually looked at the impact of our coding using the browser and refresh and tools such as margin. It was extremely difficult and frustrating to command our html to look like theirs.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

We used elements such as color, font-style, font-size.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

We definitely modified our HTML with classes and ids. We chose to use classes and ids based on specificity needed to control certain results.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

Our html/css was cleaner because:
• They don’t style their webpage with a separate style sheet. They style their page as they go.
• They used table and we haven’t => most likely more efficient (surely why we couldn’t make our page in two columns)
• They used the <br> tag in HTML i/o using CSS to code the line change
