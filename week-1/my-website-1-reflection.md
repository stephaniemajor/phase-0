•	Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository. https://github.com/stephaniemajor/stephaniemajor.github.io
•	Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
 Create a repository.
•	Go to your GitHub: https:// github.com/ yourname/
•	On the upper right corner, by your avatar, click on the “+” sign, select “New repository”
•	A new window will appear, in the empty box, name your new directory
	Make sure “Public” is checked
	In the “initialize this repository with README”  => in the “Add a license, select “MIT license”
•	Hit the “Create repository” button
Clone a repository on your local machine
•	Go to your GitHub: https:// github.com/ yourname/
•	Select the “Repositories” tab (greish upper middle section)
•	Select the repository you want to clone
•	A new window will appear. Find the “HTTPS” button (it might be located under the green line or on the lower right corner or your screen)
•	Copy the URL (you may use the little icon next to it to copy)
•	Go onto your shell/ Control Line Interface on your machine
•	Type the command: git clone ….. (….. paste the URL) => this is cloning the Github repository on your local machine)
•	Type the command LS (to see the cloned repository on your machine)
•	
•	Describe what open source means. It means that we not only see the output of a product but also the code beneath it. It is free and available to all
•	What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia? It depends what type of person you are and what your goals are. It youy are in there to make money, you will not be open to open source. If you are looking in making the best tool in the world, you will be willing to share because you can tap into everybody’s idea and skills and your product can be wow, BIG.
•	Assess the importance of using licenses. If a person is using a product without a license, this person opens up itself to law suit and reparation.  A license for someone’s product is important to control what the users can do with the product he owns. 
•	What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with? At one point, I forgot to put the “-m” with the command “git checkout” and a new window appeared to name the new branch. I was stuck, unable to get out of it.  Still not sure how I got out. Also, I misread the instructions on naming a file and did it without the md extension. I couldn’t change the name of my file on Github.I was told the format was important, so I renamed my file on my local machine and re-did the process to send it to Github
•	Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it. My husband helped me. He was great teaching me concepts with schemes.
