1.1 Think about Time
In this section, I read through a few of them, especially the being in the zone one. I compiled the 10, 7 ,etc. points from the different articles points into "the 15 points to be in the zone". I believe we should have someone aggregating them all in one section, it would be more time efficient for us to read and they are useful. Then, I really liked the one about creativity, which is helpful for creating code. The tiny habits, how to make long term changes by tiny steps and changing  your environment (spacial, social, etc)  was interesting but I am not sure , being a newbie in coding, it will help me. The article Learn Ruby the hard way had a good point, type it in it will stick in your fingers'memory.... Follow your personal rhythm article made made understand why sometime I  procrastinate and other times, I am the nicest person in my house (kind of..)

What is time Boxing. Work for a while, take a break, don't work until you are done, then take a break.

How do I manage my time currently. I don't do time boxing. I have two "To do" list, one for today, and one "Long Term" to do list. Depending on my mood, I will do the easy and quick first, or I will do the ones needing more concentration first. I tend to plan to do the ones requiring lots of concentration when it is quiet. I do not like music or white noise. Sometimes, I even go to bed early and wake up at 1 am to work on an assignment until dawn.

Is my strategy working? It is easier to do it when I work from home, when I am not stuck into a business hour schedule. But yes, my strategy works. I have a very good concentration capability.

Will I deploy any of the strategies deployed ? Yes, there is one that really stuck to me: The creativity article mentioned: "Think beyond words" Meaning, see it first, and then write it, it also mentioned  to be tolerant, in my words it means, don't limit your ideas.Yes, I will be typing the long way i/o copy-paste. And I believe, considering the how visually intensive the coding is to find errors, I will use time boxing.

My overall plan for phase 0. Working 6:30 am - 3:30 pm. Work from work (using Cloud 9) from  3:30 pm until 5:30 pm. Work on weekend (asking the hubby to take care of the kids). get a glass of one, or two, at night to relax.
1.2 The Command Line
Comparing Git and GitHub to one another. The analogy: flashdrive is Git while Dropbox is Github.
Git is a version control management tool residing locally. It not only keeps tracks of versiosn (in Git a version is called a commit) but also takes into account who did them, and when, and why. It is free. We need to learn Git commands in addition to code commands. GitHub is an online hub, therefore, it resides remotely.  The great thing about GitHub is that several people can work on the same projects at the same time. By sending my code with the Git info to the hub, and because of Git, I can get feedback, suggestions, and show others what I have worked on and where I am at. The opposite is happening too. I can see what others are doing, make comments, suggestions, etc. On the hub, we see the master code - the code reviewed, working, and debugged. Then, we see the different branches of this master.  Due to Git, we see what this branch is for, who is working on it, what has been done, etc. Git Hub helps coordinate a team effort (no duplication, suggestions can be made early on resulting in less errors, more harmony of code, etc) . Any team member can pull a branch of a master code and work on his/her feature. Here is an oversimplifying example. Let’s say we have a car – it would be the master- but then, we want to add a feature so the car would fly – the feature for flying the car needs to be developed - it would be a branch. Once we have developed, reviewed, debugged the flying feature, we would integrate it in the master (and delete the branch that is now imbedded in the master).

1.4 Forking and Cloning 


First a repository is a Git concept, a project that holds all the code for what you are doing. Therefore, when we want to do actions with repositories, we are going to do it via Github. When you create a repository, you are starting from scratch, this is a completely new project. When you fork a repository, you are copying and existing project so you add to it or modify it, but, by forking, you make sure to keep the master copy of the project original. 
Create a repository.
•	Go to your GitHub: https:// github.com/ yourname/
•	On the upper right corner, by your avatar, click on the “+” sign, select “New repository”
•	A new window will appear, in the empty box, name your new directory
	Make sure “Public” is checked
	In the “initialize this repository with README”  => in the “Add a license, select “MIT license”
•	Hit the “Create repository” button
Fork a repository
•	Go to your GitHub: https:// github.com/Devbootcamp/dashboard
•	On the righ endside, in the “Repositories “ window, find the repository you intend to fork and click on it.
•	A new window will appear.on the upper right corner, below your avatar, click on the “fork” icon
•	A pop up window will appear and ask “Where should we fork this repository?” with choices beneath. Click the one you desire

Clone a repository on your local machine
•	Go to your GitHub: https:// github.com/ yourname/
•	Select the “Repositories” tab (greish upper middle section)
•	Select the repository you want to clone
•	A new window will appear. Find the “HTTPS” button (it might be located under the green line or on the lower right corner or your screen)
•	Copy the URL (you may use the little icon next to it to copy)
•	Go onto your shell/ Control Line Interface on your machine
•	Type the command: git clone ….. (….. paste the URL) => this is cloning the Github repository on your local machine)
•	Type the command LS (to see the cloned repository on your machine)

Setting up git and github was easy, the instructions were well done.
