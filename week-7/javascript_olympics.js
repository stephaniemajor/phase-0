 // JavaScript Olympics

// I paired Thomas on this challenge.

// This challenge took me 1.5 hours.


// Warm Up
// Create an array with athlete names and their events
// var athletes = [
//     {name: "Athlete#1",
//     event: "swimming"
//     },
//     {name: "Atlete#2",
//      event: "skating"
//      }
//  ]

// Bulk Up
//  add to the array a new property called win 
// athletes.win = "#{athletes.name} won the #{athletes.event}!"
  
// console.log(athletes)


// Jumble your words
// create a function to reverse a string
// function reverse(string) {
//   var o = '';
//   for (var i = string.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
//     o += string[i];
//   return o;
// }
//  console.log(reverse("hello"))



// 2,4,6,8
//  Create a function for an array of numbers
//  function even(numbers) {
//    var newNumbers = [];
//    for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++ )
//      if (numbers % 2 == 0) {
//        newNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
//      }
//         return newNumbers;
//  }
// console.log(even(1,2,3,4,5,6));



// "We built this city"
// new Athlete("Michael Phelps", 29, "swimming", "It's medicinal I swear!")
// function michaelPhelps(){
//   name = "Michael Phelps",
//   age = 29,
//   profession = "swimming",
//   string = "It's medicinal I swear!"
// }

// console.log(michaelPhelps)

// console.log(michaelPhelps.constructor === Athlete)
// console.log(michaelPhelps.name + " " + michaelPhelps.sport + " " + michaelPhelps.quote)

// 
// function Athlete(name, age, sport, quote){
//   this.name = name;
//   this.age = age;
//   this.sport = sport;
//   this.quote = quote;
// };

// console.log(Athlete)("michael", 30, "swim", "splash")



// Reflection
// •	What JavaScript knowledge did you solidify in this challenge?
// Not to forget the parenthesis for the if, and the semi colon for the line items
// •	What are constructor functions?
// It has the “this” part with each of the properties. I didn’t really get it.
// •	How are constructors different from Ruby classes (in your research)?
// The “this” is additional. 
// Reflection solo 7.7 2-13-16
// •	What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
// To figure out how much we should do this on our own or to get inspired by the example given.then I saw that the game was pretty much the same as the example, I decided to go for the full inspirational while trying to think how to do it myself.
// •	What did you learn about creating objects and functions that interact with one another? My solution wasn’t working because I had created the variable frog independently. 
// I saw in the example provided that the variable had the function within it. This is odd to me. I would like to hear more about it.
// •	Did you learn about any new built-in methods you could use in your refactored solution? If so, what were they and how do they work?
// I had found the random method on my very first research.
// •	How can you access and manipulate properties of objects?
// By calling the variable and the method related to it
// •	Are there topics you are still struggling with?
// Yes, the literal vs the constructor version
