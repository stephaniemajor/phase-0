# Create a Bingo Scorer (SOLO CHALLENGE)

# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode
# input: two dimensional array
# output: boolean, "BINGO!"
# Create a method to iterate through an array of arrays if one array has only Xs it will print "BINGO!"
# Create a method to iterate through an array of arrays if a position for each inner array has only Xs,it will print "BINGO!" 
# Create a method to iterate through an array of arrays if a position with is the same index for the array for all has only Xs,it will print "BINGO!" 
# Create a method to iterate through an array of arrays if the max position of the min index has an X and then iterate for position minus one and index + 1, it will rpint "BINGO"

# sample boards

#               ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x'],
#               [83, 85, 97, 89, 57],
#               [25, 31, 96, 68, 51],
#               [75, 70, 54, 80, 83]]

# Initial Solution
class BingoScorer

  #your code here
# Create a method to recognize an array with Xs that will print "BINGO!"
