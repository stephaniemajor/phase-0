# Cipher Challenge

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing.
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

# def dr_evils_cipher(coded_message)
#   input = coded_message.downcase.split("") # Check out this method in IRB to see how it works! Also refer to the Ruby docs.
#   decoded_sentence = []
#   cipher = {"e" => "a",   # This is technically a shift of four letters...Can you think of a way to automate this? Is a hash
#             "f" => "b",   # the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes?
#             "g" => "c",
#             "h" => "d",
#             "i" => "e",

# Reflection
# Keep your reflection limited to 10-15 minutes!
# again, I needed help to do this. but I am getting there. I did the logic but I had difficulty to put it down into code.
